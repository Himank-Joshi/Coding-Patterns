## #Problem Explanation

    The problem "The Values You Can Make" asks us to determine the values that can be formed using a subset of coins that sum up to a given value \(k \)
        .Once we have identified a subset of coins that sums up to \(k \),
    we need to find all possible sums that can be made using any subset of this subset.

    ## #Dynamic Programming Approach

    To solve this problem,
    we can use a dynamic programming(DP) approach.Let's break down the logic:

        ####DP Table Definition
        We define a 3D DP table `dp[i][j][k]` where : - `i` represents the number of coins considered(from 1 to \(n \))
                                                          .- `j` represents the total sum we are trying to form using the first `i` coins.- `k` represents the sum of a subset of the subset that makes up sum `j`.

                                                                                                                                            The value of `dp[i][j][k]` is `True` if : -We can form sum `j` using the first `i` coins.-
        There exists a subset of these coins that sums to `k`.

        ####DP Transition
        To fill this DP table,
    we consider three cases : 1. * *The \(i \) - th coin is not used * * : `dp[i][j][k] = dp[i - 1][j][k]`.2. * *The \(i \) - th coin is used in the subset to make sum `j` but is not used in the subset of this subset * * : `dp[i][j][k] = dp[i - 1][j - c_i][k]`.3. * *The \(i \) - th coin is used in both subsets * * : `dp[i][j][k] = dp[i - 1][j - c_i][k - c_i]`.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ####Complexity
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \times k ^ 2) \),
                                                                           which is manageable within the given constraints.

                                                                           ## #C++ Code Explanation

                                                                           Here's the explanation for the provided C++ code:

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
                                                                           using namespace std;

const int N = 505;

bool dp[2][N][N]; // DP table with two layers (for current and previous states)

int main()
{
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;
    dp[0][0][0] = true; // Base case: with 0 coins, sum 0 can be formed, and subset sum 0 is possible

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
    {
        int now = i % 2;    // Current DP layer
        int last = 1 - now; // Previous DP layer
        int x = in();       // Value of the current coin

        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++)
        { // Sum we are trying to make
            for (int y = 0; y <= j; y++)
            {                                   // Subset sum of the subset that forms sum j
                dp[now][j][y] = dp[last][j][y]; // Case 1: Don't use the current coin
                if (j >= x)
                {
                    dp[now][j][y] |= dp[last][j - x][y]; // Case 2: Use coin to form sum j, not in subset
                    if (y >= x)
                    {
                        dp[now][j][y] |= dp[last][j - x][y - x]; // Case 3: Use coin in both sums
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    vector<int> res;
    for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++)
    {
        if (dp[n % 2][k][i])
        {
            res.push_back(i); // Collect all possible subset sums
        }
    }

    cout << res.size() << endl; // Number of valid subset sums
    for (int x : res)
    {
        cout << x << " "; // Print all valid sums
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

    ## #How It Works 1. *
    *Initialization ** : `dp[0][0][0] = true` sets up the base case where no coins and sum zero can be formed.2. * *DP Transition * *:
For each coin, it updates the DP table considering the three cases mentioned above.3. * *Result Collection ** : After processing all coins, the results are gathered from `dp[n % 2][k][i]` to see which subset sums are possible.

                                                                                                                                            ## #Example Walkthrough For example,
    with `n = 6`, `k = 18`, and coins `
{
    5, 6, 1, 10, 12, 2
}
`: -The DP process will determine all possible sums that can be made using any subset of coins that total to 18.

   Output will be the number of such sums and the actual sums that are possible.

   This approach effectively determines all the values that Arya can create using the subset of coins given by Pari.
